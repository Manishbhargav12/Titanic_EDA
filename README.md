# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python libraries to perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships related to passenger survival.

## üìå Objective

To analyze the Titanic dataset and discover how features like age, gender, passenger class, and family size impacted the survival chances during the Titanic disaster.

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## üîç Key Steps

- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Feature engineering (e.g., Family Size)  
- Visualization of survival distribution by gender, class, and age  
- Correlation analysis and insights generation

## üìä Highlights

- Found that females had a much higher survival rate compared to males  
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive  
- Created custom visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to show key patterns  
- Combined `SibSp` and `Parch` to create a `FamilySize` feature for deeper analysis

## üìÅ Files Included

- `titanic_eda.ipynb` ‚Äì Main Jupyter notebook with code and visualizations  
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv` ‚Äì (Optional: Add a note to download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) if not uploaded)  
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project overview and documentation
